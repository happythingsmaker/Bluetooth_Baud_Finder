# Bluetooth_Baud_Finder
BLUETOOTH BAUD FINDER


This is an Arduino Code for Modifying Bluetooth Setting such as HC05, HM10

There are many version of Bluetooth Modules
Everytime I tried to set up bluetooth, I had to select various baudrate settings.

This code finds baudrate of Bluetooth and set 
the Software Serial Communication based on the baudrate which was found

You can start to set up with AT command without boring works
